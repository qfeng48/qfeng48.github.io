I am a second-year PhD student in the School of [Operations Research and Information Engineering](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie), Cornell University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Omar El Houseni](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/oe46/) and [Huseyin Topaloglu](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/huseyin/). I also worked with [Ruihao Zhu](https://rzhu.github.io/) at SC Johnson College of Business, Cornell University.

I am broadly interested in approximation algorithms and data-driven algorithms with applications in revenue management and pricing.

Prior to joining Cornell, I obtained a BS in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Fudan University in 2022.
