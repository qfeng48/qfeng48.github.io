I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the School of [Operations Research and Information Engineering](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie), Cornell University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Omar El Housni](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/oe46/) and [Huseyin Topaloglu](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/huseyin/). I am also fortunate to collaborate with [Ruihao Zhu](https://rzhu.github.io/) at SC Johnson College of Business, Cornell University.

I am broadly interested in approximation algorithms and data-driven algorithms with applications in revenue management and pricing.

Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained my bachelor degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Fudan University in 2022.
